how to handle files like md. ???
got to know a way of checking folders :
            check_dir                                                                                                                                                   
        1 if  [ -d tests ] ;
        2 then 
        3     echo exists
        4 fi
another thing is that ./tests/dir1/ is eq to ./tests//dir1/

handled exception when destination doesn't exists

the exception when two file of same name are present handled
explain : 
    stat ./tests/pond/dir1/image.jpg | sed -n '/Birth/p' | awk 'BEGIN{FS=" "}{print $2}' | awk 'BEGIN{FS="-"} {print $3$2$1}'
 gives ddmmyyyy

 Handled log and temp file .folders_list

 handle case when called multiple times and same timestamps don't get considered

 handled -d removal option
 handled cat nofile error use redirection

 what to do when more than two files are supposed to have the same name ?
