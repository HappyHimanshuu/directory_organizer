Directory Organizer Usage Manual:

The Directory Organizer is a tool designed to help you organize your files in a directory. It provides several options for efficient file management. Below are the available options:

-d: This option deletes the files that have been organized from the source directory. No parameter is required.

-e <ext1,ext2>: Use this option to exclude specific file extensions from the organization process. Multiple extensions can be provided as a comma-separated list.

-l <log_name>: Specify the name of the log file to be generated during the organization process. The log file will contain information about the files moved. Provide the desired log file name as a parameter.

-s <date/ext>: Choose one of the two organization schemes: "date" or "ext." The "date" scheme organizes files based on their creation date, while the "ext" scheme organizes files by their extensions.

-m <param>: Play a background music file during the organization process. By default, the file "bgm.mp3" is played. You can specify a different music file by providing its name as a parameter.

-g <param>: This option takes a sed statement that can be used to filter files based on custom criteria. Exercise caution when using this option, as it may produce unpredictable results. By default, the sed statements are set to '/\/[^/.]\+\.\?[^/.]\+$/p' and '/\/[^./]$/p'. You can modify these statements to match your specific filtering needs.

Here are a few examples of using the -g option:
- To include only .sh files in your source directory: '/\.sh$/p'
- To include both .sh and .tar files: '/\.sh$\|\.tar$/p'
- To include files with regular naming such as abc.txt etc, use the sed
  '/\/[^/.]\+\.[^/.]\+$\|\/[^./]$/p'
- To only get files with noextensions, use the sed
  '/\/[^./]\+$/p'
Please note that the provided sed statements are just examples, and you can customize them as per your requirements.
